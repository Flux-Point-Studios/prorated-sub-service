# üö® SECURITY BREACH RESOLVED - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## What Happened
Private wallet keys were accidentally committed to the public repository. These keys have been exposed and must be considered **COMPROMISED**.

## What We've Done
‚úÖ Removed wallet files from git tracking
‚úÖ Added `wallets/` to `.gitignore` to prevent future commits
‚úÖ **Cleaned entire git history** - all traces of wallet files have been removed from all commits
‚úÖ Performed aggressive garbage collection to permanently delete the data

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Next Steps You MUST Take

### 1. Force Push to Remote Repository
```bash
git push --force origin main
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This will rewrite the remote repository history. Make sure all team members are aware.

### 2. Check for Any Forks/Clones
- Check if anyone has forked or cloned your repository
- They may still have copies of the compromised keys
- Notify them immediately to delete their copies

### 3. Generate NEW Wallets Immediately
The current wallets in `subscription/wallets/` are COMPROMISED and must be replaced:

```bash
cd subscription/wallets

# For each wallet (admin, merchant, subscriber):
cd admin
cardano-cli address key-gen \
  --verification-key-file payment.vkey \
  --signing-key-file payment.skey

cardano-cli stake-address key-gen \
  --verification-key-file stake.vkey \
  --signing-key-file stake.skey

cardano-cli address build \
  --payment-verification-key-file payment.vkey \
  --stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
  --out-file payment.addr \
  --mainnet

# Repeat for merchant/ and subscriber/
```

### 4. URGENT: Move Any Funds
If these wallets contain ANY funds on mainnet or testnet:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** transfer all funds to new secure wallets
2. The compromised keys could be used by anyone who saw your repository

### 5. Update All References
Search your codebase for any hardcoded references to the old addresses and update them:
- Scripts
- Configuration files
- Documentation
- Test files

### 6. Security Audit
- Review all other files in your repository for sensitive data
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive information
- Never commit private keys, API keys, or passwords

## Compromised Files (Now Removed)
The following files were exposed and have been removed from git history:
- `subscription/wallets/admin/payment.skey` ‚ùå
- `subscription/wallets/admin/stake.skey` ‚ùå
- `subscription/wallets/merchant/payment.skey` ‚ùå
- `subscription/wallets/merchant/stake.skey` ‚ùå
- `subscription/wallets/subscriber/payment.skey` ‚ùå
- `subscription/wallets/subscriber/stake.skey` ‚ùå
- All associated `.vkey` and `.addr` files

## Prevention for the Future
1. **Always** check `.gitignore` before first commit
2. Use `git status` carefully before committing
3. Consider using pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental key commits
4. Store keys in a secure location outside the repository
5. Use hardware wallets for production keys

## Git History Verification
To verify the cleaning worked:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- subscription/wallets/
# Should return nothing if properly cleaned
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember**: Even though we've cleaned the git history, if your repository was public, assume the keys were compromised and act accordingly!
