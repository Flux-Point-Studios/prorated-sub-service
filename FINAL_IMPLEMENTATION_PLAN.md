# TALOS Subscription Service - Final Implementation Plan

## Project Status

We have successfully created the Aiken project structure and implemented the core smart contract code for the TALOS token subscription system. The implementation follows the requirements specified in the README.md:

1. **On-Chain Components**:
   - ✅ SubscriptionDatum structure with owner and start_time
   - ✅ Validator spending logic with time-based penalty tiers (30%, 20%, 10%, 0%)
   - ✅ NFT minting policy for subscription tokens
   - ✅ Penalty distribution mechanism
   - ✅ Test files for validator logic

2. **Off-Chain Components**:
   - ✅ Sample script for subscription (JavaScript/Lucid)
   - ✅ Sample script for withdrawal (JavaScript/Lucid)

## What's Missing

Before the project can be deployed, the following items need to be addressed:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - A proper Aiken development environment needs to be set up. We've installed Aiken in WSL, but need a stable terminal for running commands
   - The code needs to be compiled and tested with `aiken check` and `aiken build`
   - Generate the Plutus script with `aiken blueprint`

2. **Parameters and Configuration**:
   - **TALOS Token Details**: The exact policy ID and asset name of the TALOS token need to be determined
   - **Admin Address**: The treasury wallet address that will receive penalty fees must be specified
   - **Reference Script**: For optimization, a reference script deployment strategy is needed

3. **NFT Metadata**:
   - Define the metadata structure for subscription NFTs
   - Include expiry information in the metadata for off-chain verification

4. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Full integration testing on testnet
   - Security review and audit
   - Mainnet preparation

## Technical Gaps to Address

1. **Script Addressing**:
   - The validator uses `self_spending_hash` to get its own script hash. This should be verified to ensure it works as expected with Plutus V3.

2. **Time Handling**:
   - The contract uses milliseconds for time calculations. This should be verified against Cardano's slot-based timing.

3. **NFT Uniqueness**:
   - The current approach relies on creating unique NFT names. This should be bulletproof to prevent duplicate NFTs.

4. **Reference Scripts**:
   - The off-chain code includes a reference to a reference script, but this hasn't been fully implemented.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Compile and Test the Contract**:
   ```bash
   cd subscription
   aiken check
   aiken build
   aiken blueprint
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**:
   - Update the script parameters with actual values:
     - Admin address
     - TALOS token policy ID
     - TALOS token asset name

3. **Test on Testnet**:
   - Deploy the contract to preprod/preview testnet
   - Create test subscriptions
   - Test early withdrawal with penalties
   - Test full-term withdrawal

4. **Finalize Documentation**:
   - Create detailed deployment instructions
   - Document the API for off-chain integration

## Long-term Considerations

1. **Monitoring Solution**:
   - Create a monitoring tool to track active subscriptions
   - Implement alerts for expiring subscriptions

2. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a frontend for users to manage their subscriptions
   - Integrate with popular Cardano wallets

3. **Governance**:
   - Consider a mechanism for handling long-dormant deposits (e.g., subscriptions never withdrawn)

4. **Security Audit**:
   - Have the contract professionally audited before mainnet deployment

## Conclusion

The TALOS subscription service smart contract is well-designed and largely implemented. The contract follows the requirements specified in the README.md, implementing a time-based penalty system for early withdrawals and using NFTs as subscription certificates. 

With proper testing and parameter configuration, it will be ready for deployment. The most critical next steps are compiling the Aiken code, generating the Plutus script, and conducting thorough testing on the testnet.

The design provides a secure, trustless subscription service that allows users to lock TALOS tokens for a 30-day period, with appropriate penalties for early withdrawals. This approach provides flexibility for users while ensuring subscription commitments through financial incentives.
