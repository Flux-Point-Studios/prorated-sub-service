# TALOS Subscription Service - Project Status

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the TALOS subscription service smart contract based on the requirements in the README.md. The implementation includes:

### Completed Work:

1. **Smart Contract (On-Chain)**
   - ✅ Two-part validator system:
     - `spend_validator`: Handles subscription withdrawals with time-based penalties
     - `mint_validator`: Handles NFT minting for subscriptions
   - ✅ Subscription datum structure with owner's verification key and start time
   - ✅ Time-based penalty logic (30%, 20%, 10%, 0% based on elapsed time)
   - ✅ Transaction validation to enforce correct penalty distribution
   - ✅ NFT burning logic for subscription termination

2. **Off-Chain Code**
   - ✅ Example script for creating subscriptions using JavaScript/Lucid
   - ✅ Example script for withdrawals with penalty calculation

3. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Implementation plan with technical details
   - ✅ Setup guide for Ubuntu environment
   - ✅ Code structure documentation

### Modified for Current Aiken Syntax:

The original implementation needed several syntax updates to work with the current version of Aiken:

1. Split the combined validator into separate spending and minting validators
2. Updated ByteArray literals to use hex encoding
3. Changed enum access from double colons (::) to dot notation (.)
4. Fixed namespacing for transaction types

## Next Steps

The following tasks are needed to complete the project:

1. **Environment Setup and Compilation**
   - ⬜ Set up a stable environment for Aiken (recommended: dedicated Ubuntu terminal)
   - ⬜ Compile the code using the provided guide
   - ⬜ Run tests and verify the validator logic
   - ⬜ Generate the Plutus scripts with `aiken blueprint`

2. **Configuration and Parameters**
   - ⬜ Determine the actual TALOS token policy ID and asset name
   - ⬜ Define the treasury/admin address for receiving penalties
   - ⬜ Update all parameter values in the scripts

3. **Testing and Deployment**
   - ⬜ Deploy reference scripts to testnet
   - ⬜ Test the subscription lifecycle on testnet
   - ⬜ Security review and optimization
   - ⬜ Prepare for mainnet deployment

4. **Integration**
   - ⬜ Create integration examples with real wallets
   - ⬜ Develop frontend components for user interaction
   - ⬜ Document the API for off-chain services

5. **Monitoring**
   - ⬜ Plan for subscription tracking and monitoring
   - ⬜ Consider governance for long-term deposits

## Technical Considerations

1. **Script Size Optimization**
   - The separation of validators helps optimize script size
   - Reference scripts will further reduce transaction costs

2. **NFT Metadata**
   - Consider standardizing NFT metadata to include subscription details
   - Add expiration date in the metadata for off-chain verification

3. **Security Considerations**
   - The validator ensures only the owner can withdraw funds
   - The time-based validation prevents manipulation of penalties
   - All tokens are properly accounted for (no leakage)

## Conclusion

The TALOS subscription smart contract is now ready for compilation and testing. The implementation follows the requirements specified in the README.md, with updated syntax for the current version of Aiken. 

Once compiled and tested, the contract will provide a secure, trustless subscription service that allows users to lock TALOS tokens for a 30-day period, with appropriate penalties for early withdrawals. The next critical steps are environment setup, compilation, and testnet deployment.
